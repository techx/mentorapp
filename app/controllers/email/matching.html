        <p>
           Are you new to coding? Unfamiliar with software you want to use? Not sure where to start? If your team qualifies as a beginner team (more than half your members have less than one year of coding experience), we are offering the option to get matched with a personal mentor that will offer guidance throughout the hackathon. <br>Interested? Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8rkuVisHBUpWf3zPex_TebDsbA8ccDvZdtMJjVjCE_DkR-w/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">this form</a> before 2pm EDT, and we will get back to you with mentor matches shortly. Happy hacking!
        </p>
        <p>Please email help@hackmit.org with any questions.</p>
        <p>Best,<br>HackMIT</p>
